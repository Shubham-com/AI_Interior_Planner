# def recommend_furniture(furniture_dir, room_image):
#     # Here, you would implement the logic to recommend furniture based on the given room image
#     # For demonstration purposes, let's assume we have a list of predefined furniture items
#     # and we randomly select a few of them as recommendations
    
#     # Sample list of furniture items
#     furniture_list = ['Sofa', 'Bed', 'Table', 'Chair', 'Bookshelf']
    
#     # Return a subset of the furniture list as recommendations
#     recommendations = furniture_list[:3]  # For example, recommend the first 3 items
#     return recommendations
